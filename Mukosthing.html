   <p>
    Hey Muko. I made this website for you. I hope you like it!<br>
    I know it took a while, but I wanted to make it special for you.<br>
    Also, it took forever to make some things work, I had to publish it to actually send it to you and omds, it was a lot. Anyway, it's done now and I'm proud of it... mostly.<br>
    I know we haven't been friends for the longest time but you're a friend that I really appreciate and wanna keep in my life.
    You're a real one, and you're really cool. And if things had happened differently, well, Ig you can't miss what you never had, right?<br>
    Anyway, as a token of my appreciation and a way to practice my coding skills, this is a declaration of my undying love for you(hehehe). I hope you like it, and I hope you know that you're a great person and a great friend.<br>
   </p>
   <p>
    P.S. I know you like the color purple, so I made sure to use it a lot. I hope you like it!<br>

    I thought and thought bout what to write, then decided on the perfect thing. You'll never guess. It's cheesy pick up lines!!!!!!!!! Yay!<br>
    <li>Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears.</li>
    <li>Do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your eyes.</li>
    <li>Is your name Google? Because you have everything Iâ€™m searching for.</li>
    <li>Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?</li>
    <li>Are you a parking ticket? Because youâ€™ve got FINE written all over you.</li>
    <li>Do you have a Band-Aid? Because I just scraped my knee falling for you.</li>
    <li>Are you a campfire? Because youâ€™re hot and I want sâ€™more.</li>
    <li>Is your dad a boxer? Because youâ€™re a knockout!</li>
   </p>
   <p>  
    Just so you know, I mean everyone of these so you should read them in my voice and imagine me smoldering. I love you bro, otherwise I wouldn't have made this thing that looks real simple but actually ate up so much of my time and took a ton of effort.<br>
    when I learn JavaScript, which is another coding language which basically makes websites interactive and wayyyy more fun, I'll make you another website. Right now I only know HTML and CSS, that's why I can't do much but you know, I'm learning so yeah.<br>
